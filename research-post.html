                <h3 id="subheading">Abstract</h3>
                <p>The development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has many comparative advantages over ordinary vehicles that require direct human input in terms of the environmental effect and the safety of passengers. The purpose of this research was to
                    evaluate the likelihood of self-driving vehicles replacing conventional automobiles in the USA in the next ten years. This research was done by considering other studies related to the same topic, and therefore, the methodology is
                    a meta-analysis. The findings showed that the development directions of large car manufacturers and taxi corporations look forward to the invention of AVs. The results of the research conclude that the AVs are more likely to partially
                    replace the conventional ones due to their potential benefits including positive effects on the environment, advanced safety measures and the future trends of the large vehicle manufacturers as well as taxi corporations. <br></p>
                <h3
                    id="subheading">1.0 Introduction</h3>
                    <p>There is a growing trend in the car industry in the development of self-driving automobiles which can drive without human interaction in the U.S. Large taxi corporations such as Uber and Lyft have invested a significant amount of money
                        in the development of the AVs due to the promising potential of the technology. The U.S. society would significantly benefit from the broad deployment of autonomous AVs. Currently, the driver error results in 93% of road accidents
                        out of all crashes annually in the USA, precisely because of distracted or drunk drivers and speeding (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 2008 quoted in Fagnant and Kockelman 2015, 169). AVs have the potential to reduce
                        the number of road accidents by 80% to 90% reinforcing public transportation safety (Greenblatt and Shaheen 2015, 76).<br></p>
                    <p>The paper aims to evaluate the likelihood of self-driving vehicles replacing conventional automobiles in the USA in the next decade. This research project initially analyses the safety measures of autonomous cars, followed by the evaluation
                        of their effect on the environment. Next, the trends and contributions of large corporations will be discussed. Finally, the paper would evaluate challenges for the future adoption of AVs. This essay will argue that even though
                        the future introduction of AVs could be challenging due to the technological costs and people uncertainty in the USA, the self-driving vehicles are more likely to partially replace the conventional vehicles in the next decade because
                        of their capability to significantly reduce the number of car accidents, the positive effect on the environment and the development directions of large car and taxi corporations.<br></p>
                    <h3 id="subheading">2.0 Safety measures<br></h3>
                    <p>One of the most important factors that play a high role in the future transition from conventional to AVs in the USA is the safety measures of the vehicles. There are approximately 5,5 million crashes in the U.S. annually while a human
                        error was responsible for 93% of the happened accidents (U.S. Department of Transportation 2013 quoted in Fagnant and Kockelman 2015, 169; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 2008 quoted in Fagnant and Kockelman 2015,
                        169). Moreover, according to the U.S. Census Bureau (2012 quoted in Howard and Danielle 2013, 3), almost 35,000 Americans die in vehicle crashes annually. Furthermore, the economic costs of all automobile crashes in the U.S. accounting
                        for approximately 277 billion dollars (Blincoe et al. 2014 quoted in Fagnant and Kockelman 2015, 169). However, those considerable numbers of accidents could be substantially reduced as well as economic costs through the extensive
                        penetration of driverless vehicles.<br></p>
                    <div id="sub-container" style="margin-left: 64px;">
                        <h3 id="subheading">2.1. Artificial Intelligence<br></h3>
                        <p>The driverless automobiles are able to drive and select safe decisions by themselves due to artificial intelligence. Specific datasets train the intelligence of the self-driving cars. Training of the machine based on the datasets
                            can be compared to the driving experience of a human driver. For instance, KITTY and the Cityspaces are the datasets that have been introduced in order to train and test AVs for recognition, motion estimation and computer vision
                            tasks (Geiger et al. 2012 quoted in Janai et al. 2017, 3; Cordts et al. 2016 quoted in Janai et al. 2017, 3). While contemporary self-driving cars’ capabilities are already able to interpret the complex data and safely respond
                            to the real-life situations, the further safety measures would be steadily improved for those vehicles in the form of training them on new datasets and driving on roads. For these reasons, the self-driving automobiles would
                            probably be much safer compared to human drivers.<br></p>
                        <h3 id="subheading">2.2 Technological safety advancements</h3>
                        <p>The Level 4 and Level 5 (see in the glossary) driverless cars would significantly advance public safety. Many AV developers such as Google are using Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging system (see in the glossary) or LIDAR (Asvadi
                            et al. 2016, 1) which plays the role of vision or an eye of a driverless vehicle. LIDAR gathers information from the environment of a self-driving car and delivers data to a machine or a computer which then decides better options.
                            Thereupon, Clements and Kockelman (2017, 109) agree that the Level 4 and Level 5 self-driving vehicles with LIDAR, 360-degree visual sensors, lasers and artificial intelligence systems which can identify objects behind other
                            objects would make driving much safer. For instance, in California, Google’s autonomous cars which are powered by LIDAR have travelled more than one million miles, and there were only 12 accidents where Google’s cars were not
                            responsible for it (Google Self-Driving Car Project Monthly Report 2015 quoted in Clements and Kockelman 2017, 108). In contrast, human error was a primary factor of all accidents. <br></p>
                        <p>Furthermore, oncoming advancements in AV technology will also lead to the development of the vehicle to vehicle communication (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure communication (V2I) (Tettamanti, Varga and Szalay 2016, 245). The
                            V2V technology enables cars to communicate with each other by sending the gathered data from sensors, cameras and other sources in real time. So, cars can warn each other about imminent road threats. Thereupon, it expands the
                            vehicle’s view considerably. Summarising all the facts and reasons, it could be concluded that AV technology advancements make driving much safer attracting more consumers to use them or use the ride sharing services.<br></p>
                        <p>Therefore, considering all of the technologies and oncoming inventions such as LIDAR system, V2V and V2I communication and the development of advanced artificial intelligence, there would be probably high consumer demand for self-driving
                            vehicles in the next decade due to their advanced safety measures in comparison with the ordinary cars where safety liability lies only on the human driver.<br></p>
                    </div>
                    <h3 id="subheading">3.0 Environmental benefits<br></h3>
                    <p>The significant aspect that encourages the high investments from the U.S. Department of Transportation towards AVs is the environmental benefits. In contrast to conventional cars which require a direct human input, the self-driving
                        cars have a high potential to reduce greenhouse emissions. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (2016, 1), the transportation sector is responsible for 28% out of total greenhouse emissions in the USA,
                        while the light-duty vehicles made up approximately 60% of the sector’s emissions in 2014. Moreover, the emissions from the transportation sector exceed those from power plants (Plumer 2016 quoted in Alexander-Kearns, Peterson
                        and Cassady 2016, 3). With these two facts expressly conveyed, it is essential to address the benefits that driverless cars present. The general influence of the AVs towards the environment could be measured through two main criteria:
                        the impact on congestions and fuel economy.<br></p>
                    <div id="sub-container">
                        <h3 id="subheading">3.1 Impact on congestions<br></h3>
                        <p>One of the most influential aspects of the future development of transportation systems is the reduction of highway congestions. When traffic congestion rises, it causes a dramatic boost in fuel consumption and the number of greenhouse
                            gases produced by vehicles. For example, Texas Transportation Institute (2010 quoted in Howard and Danielle 2013, 3) reveals that traffic jams produce approximately 56 billion pounds of carbon dioxide and cost the U.S. economy
                            more than 120 billion dollars.<br></p>
                        <p>According to Julia Piper (2014 quoted in Alexander-Kearns, Peterson and Cassady 2016, 15), there was the development<br>of communication systems and its testing implemented by researchers from Oak Ridge to afford self-driving vehicles
                            to interact with each other. The Andreas Malikopoulos who works in the laboratory’s Urban Dynamics Institute states that Level 4 and 5 vehicles will be able to communicate with each other via vehicle to vehicle communication
                            technology. Through V2V communication the number of traffic jams on the roads will significantly decline, and therefore there will be fewer vehicle emissions (Eugensson et al. 2014 quoted in Alexander-Kearns, Peterson and Cassady
                            2016, 17). Also, the survey conducted by the Schoettle and Sivak (2014, 9) depicts that the U.S. public expectations seem to be very positive towards the reduction in traffic congestions as well as in the lower vehicle emissions
                            since approximately 64% of respondents suggested that these will likely to happen. Thus, the AV technology would probably bring an essential contribution to the reduction of vehicle emissions and congestions in the USA.<br></p>
                        <h3
                            id="subheading">3.2 Fuel efficiency</h3>
                            <p>Another important aspect that should be considered is the driving behaviour of humans compared to AVs. For example, Texas Transportation Institute estimated that congestions are the loss of a large amount of fuel as the cars
                                with a driver waste 1.9 billion gallons of fuel there (Silberg et al. 2012 quoted in Clements and Kockelman 2017, 111). <br></p>
                            <p>However, according to Berry (2010 quoted in Alexander-Kearns, Peterson and Cassady 2016, 2), the AVs technology affords to deal with that relevant problem through the development of communication channels since the autonomous
                                vehicles may drive more smoothly reducing frequent accelerations and decelerations that results in 5 per cent less fuel consumption. Silberg et al. (2012 quoted in Clements and Kockelman 2017, 111) also state that there
                                would be significant advancements in fuel efficiency if the computer-controlled cars would interact with the surroundings including other driverless vehicles and infrastructure. Based on these pieces of evidence, the self-driving
                                cars will probably bring considerable advancements in fuel efficiency. <br></p>
                            <p>Consequently, since the transportation sector of the United States significantly damages the air quality, the future transportation systems and traffic industry would probably transfer their interests from the conventional
                                vehicles requiring a direct human input to the AVs which respond to the problems of climate change and greenhouse emissions. <br></p>
                    </div>
                    <h3 id="subheading">4.0 Future trends of large car companies<br></h3>
                    <div id="sub-container" style="margin-left: 64px;">
                        <h3 id="subheading">4.1 Ride sharing<br></h3>
                        <p>In the next decade, the AVs are very likely to partially replace the conventional automobiles due to the possible end or decline in the individual car ownership that would be partly substituted by a ride sharing. Between 2020 and
                            2030, there could be significant changes in terms of the way of transportation. Menon (2017) states that future transportation advancements could bring the new concept of transportation called shared autonomous vehicles (SAV)
                            which could be a cheap and on-demand mobility service. <br></p>
                        <p>Taxi corporations such as Uber and Lyft are significantly contributing to the oncoming replacement to self-driving vehicles because their trends directly influence the way of transportation of a large number of people. For instance,
                            in 2015, Uber corporation drove approximately 450,000 passengers per day in New York City alone (Wallsten 2015, 8). According to Menon (2017), Uber and Lyft have made significant investments advancing the AVs and Artificial
                            Intelligence technologies emerging SAV business models. Thereupon, the AVs would be deployed to some extent in the U.S. roads in the next decade. <br></p>
                        <p>Moreover, Diamandis (2014 quoted in Clements and Kockelman 2017, 107) revealed that private car ownership might experience dramatic downward trend as the taxi services of Lyft and Uber will develop. While Lyft predicts that vehicle
                            ownership may end by 2025 (Kosoff 2016 quoted in Menon 2017). Specifically, in the USA, there could be a decline in the<br>personal demand for cars by millions of units per year if ride sharing becomes a popular mode choice
                            among the public (Silberg et al. 2012 quoted in Clements and Kockelman 2017, 107).<br></p>
                        <p>It can be summarised that the taxi companies play a significant role in stimulating the further transition from conventional automobiles that require human inputs to fully AVs.<br></p>
                        <h3 id="subheading">4.2 Car manufacturers<br></h3>
                        <p>The number of AVs in the U.S. roads is constantly increasing. Tesla Motors have already introduced Level 3 AVs in 2017 that are available in the U.S. market. Moreover, Tesla Motors plan to release Level 4 system by 2020 (Seward
                            2014 quoted in Greenblatt and Shaheen 2015, 75). Furthermore, the large car manufacturers such as Toyota, Ford, BMW, Mercedes, Nissan and others have already set dates of inventing their Level 4 self-driving vehicles. According
                            to Jaynes and Naughton (2016 quoted in Alexander-Kearns, Peterson and Cassady 2016, 7), Ford Motor Corporation announced that automobiles with Level 4 autonomy would be released in 2025 while BMW plans to release the vehicles
                            with the same level in 2021. General Motors that produced just over 3 million automobiles in 2017 taking 17.1% of market share in the USA plans to develop their Level 4 AVs by 2025 (General Motors Company 2017, 22; Alexander-Kearns,
                            Peterson and Cassady 2016, 7).<br></p>
                        <p>Consequently, the AVs are more likely to replace the substantial portion of conventional cars in the U.S. roads with Level 0 autonomy by the end of the next decade while the market share for Level 3 and Level 4 AVs will probably
                            experience a steady upward trend.&nbsp;<br></p>
                    </div>
                    <h3 id="subheading">5.0 Challenges<br></h3>
                    <div id="sub-container">
                        <h3 id="subheading">5.1 Technological costs</h3>
                        <p>The extensive deployment of AV may not happen in the next 10 years due to the high prices of AVs and their components. According to Shchetko (2014 quoted in Fagnant and Kockelman 2015, 176), the cost of a single LIDAR system that
                            is used in many AVs ranges from $30,000 to $85,000 while there would be additional costs for other sensors, software and computer hardware. Anderson et al. (2014 quoted in Greenblatt and Shaheen 2015, 76) also agree that the
                            prices for self-driving vehicles starting from the Level 3 and above are unaffordable for many people as their prices roughly equal to 150,000 US dollars. Moreover, the deployment of Level 3, Level 4 and Level 5 driverless
                            cars also requires a large number of investments towards the development of roads and additional public infrastructure in order to maintain vehicle connectivity with its surrounding (Fagnant and Kockelman 2015, 167). Nevertheless,
                            Fagnant and Kockelman (2015, 168) predict that the prices for AVs would steadily drop in the next five years. <br></p>
                        <h3 id="subheading">5.2 Consumer’s uncertainty</h3>
                        <p>Another crucial challenge towards the deployment of self-driving automobiles is the concerns of the public in the USA. According to Brandon’ and Sivak’ (2014, 13) survey, the majority of respondents are very concerned about location
                            and destination tracking or data privacy, system performance during the harsh weather and interaction with non-autonomous vehicles. Sun (2014) also states that since the AVs are the products of increased risk, it would take
                            a long time for the AVs corporations to deserve a trust of the public.<br></p>
                    </div>
                    <h3 id="subheading">6.0 Conclusion<br></h3>
                    <p>This essay argued that the AVs are more likely to partially replace the conventional vehicles at the end of the next decade due to the current trends of vehicle manufacturers as well as taxi corporations, AVs’ advanced safety measures
                        and their environmental benefits. However, the deployment process may slow down because of the concerns of the U.S. public and high technological prices for self-driving vehicles with Level 3 and above. The purpose of the paper
                        was to evaluate the likelihood of self-driving vehicles replacing conventional automobiles in the United States in the next 10 years. Large vehicle manufacturers are planning to produce AVs while taxi corporations are planning
                        to use the AVs as a service. Moreover, AVs advanced safety measures may reduce the high number of road accidents in the USA eliminating the significant economic costs. Furthermore, the driverless cars will probably cut a substantial
                        portion of greenhouse emissions coming from the transportation sector in the country because of the high fuel efficiency and reduction of congestions. Nevertheless, this paper has not assessed other essential factors of the future
                        deployment of driverless cars including the liabilities of a driver, cases of system malfunctioning and regulation of automated driving. In order to properly manage and develop the intelligent future transportation systems which

                        <p>Level 0 - No automation.<br>Level 1 - Autonomy of one primary control function, e.g., adaptive cruise control, self-parking, lane-keep assist, or autonomous braking.<br>Level 2 - Autonomy of two or more primary control functions
                            designed to work in unison to relieve the driver of control of those functions.<br>Level 3 - Limited self-driving; a driver may cede full control of all safety‐critical functions under certain traffic or environmental conditions,
                            but it is expected to be available for occasional control with adequate warning.<br>Level 4 - Full self-driving; a driver is not expected to be available for control at any time during the trip (includes unoccupied vehicles).<br>Level

                            The system, which incorporates time-dependent data, is composed of two main modules: (i) an effective ground surface estimation using a piecewise plane-fitting algorithm and RANSAC-method, and (ii) a voxel-grid model for static
                            and moving obstacles detection using discriminative analysis and ego-motion information. This perception system has direct application in safety systems for intelligent vehicles, particularly in collision avoidance and vulnerable
                            road users detection, namely pedestrians and cyclists.<br></p>
